    <h2>Importance of Healthy Leaves</h2>
    <p>Healthy leaves are essential for optimal growth and yield in groundnut plants. They perform vital functions like photosynthesis, nutrient absorption, and energy production, contributing to plant vigor and overall crop quality.</p>
    
    <h2>Organic Methods for Leaf Health</h2>
    <p>Organic practices play a crucial role in maintaining healthy leaves and promoting plant resilience. Key methods include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost, manure, and bio-based fertilizers to provide essential nutrients for leaf development and vitality.</li>
      <li><strong>Soil Enrichment:</strong> Incorporate organic matter into the soil to improve soil structure, nutrient availability, and microbial activity, supporting healthy leaf growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Pest Management:</strong> Employ biological controls, companion planting, and beneficial insects to manage pests and prevent leaf damage without chemical interventions.</li>
      <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Maintain weed-free conditions around groundnut plants to reduce competition for nutrients and sunlight, ensuring optimal leaf health.</li>
      <li><strong>Proper Watering:</strong> Water plants consistently and avoid water stress to maintain turgid and healthy leaves.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By prioritizing organic methods, nutrient-rich soil, natural pest management, and proper cultural practices, farmers can achieve and maintain healthy leaves in groundnut plants. This leads to improved plant vigor, disease resistance, and ultimately higher yields.</p>
