      <li><strong>Proper Irrigation:</strong> Ensure coconut plants receive adequate and consistent water to prevent water stress and maintain leaflet hydration.</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Pest Control:</strong> Use organic methods such as neem oil, beneficial insects, or botanical extracts to manage pests and prevent damage to leaflets.</li>
      <li><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Employ cultural practices like proper sanitation, crop rotation, and use of disease-resistant varieties to prevent and manage diseases that affect leaflet health.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Considerations:</strong> Provide adequate shade, protect plants from extreme weather conditions, and maintain optimal growing conditions to support healthy leaflet development.</li>
    </ul>
